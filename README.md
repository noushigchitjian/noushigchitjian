## Hi there 👋

My name is Noushig, I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Web Developer with a strong focus on creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. My expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows me to build visually appealing and highly interactive web applications. Over the years, I've also expanded my skill set to include Python, jQuery, Razor, and C#, enabling me to seamlessly integrate front-end experiences with back-end functionality.

- 🎨 Front-End Specialist: Crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces is my forte. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code that brings designs to life.

- 💻 Full-Stack Developer: While my heart lies in front-end development, I’m equally capable of tackling back-end challenges to ensure a smooth and cohesive user experience.

- 🚀 Continuous Learner: I'm always eager to stay updated with the latest trends in web development and continuously refine my skills.
